# homelab
 
## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TomTruyen/homelab.git
```

## TODO:
- Move other homelab configs to here
- Create a script/docker that can be run from the repo root that installs everything
  ==> This script should clearly state at the end which manual steps need to be done still, like setting up Cloudflared for the Tunnel
